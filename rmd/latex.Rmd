# LaTeX

## List of tables and figures

Normally, the caption for list of tables and list of figures is shown no matter tables or figures exist. i found a solution for only displaying a list if there's an item available for that. That code is in *preamble.tex* under the corresponding caption as a comment. Using the package *xassoccnt* triggers the warning:

> Warning: Package xassoccnt Warning: Warning: Package "calc" is loaded -- this is not\
> Warning: (xassoccnt)                recommended for xassoccnt\
> Warning: (xassoccnt)                

*calc* is being called directly from *default.latex* and as i don't want to modify the contents of *default.latex*, i have to live with the warning.
